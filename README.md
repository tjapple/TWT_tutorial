-only farm accounts can sell (have an order form)
-only restaurant accounts can buy (can access order forms)

-make public information farm-to-restaurant, so 'user' account type has access to posts made in a given region. No need to 'follow' accounts. 
    -still need to do: JOIN posts and completed_orders so that they both appear on home screen and profile pages. 

-home page includes recent supply confirmations, each post maybe includes what the restaurant will use the item for, so order form must accept comment box from restaurant. 

-restaurant user page includes name, location, type of food, about, typical suppliers

-farm user page includes name, location, type of produce, about
    -link to farm order form.
        -order submissions must be accepted by the farm 
            -order submission triggers email/text to farm
        -request order form has parameters for minimum amount required to trigger delivery.
        -table of produce with prices.
